# Event package for Pipeline Event Plugin

This package is design to easily handle the data sent by the [pipeline-event](https://github.com/JohnNiang/pipeline-event-plugin) plugin. In the future, it needs to be independent into a separate project. If anyone is interested, you are very welcome to complete this task.
